## TODO

- speedups

  - [x] only sort / have data structures when they are necessary
  - [ ] only store keys + write to buffered writer immediately
  - [x] only sort keys on rqs when there is an rq
  - [x] use indexes instead of pointers
  - [ ] when comparing non-zero values, use multiple threads
  - [ ] io_uring

- [ ] run a check of the workload spec before generating to check for errors like more deletes than valid keys or having
      non-empty pqs without any inserts

- [ ] warnings about keyspace and how picking a small space could lead to lots of failed generation of empty point queries

- [ ] create some sort of workload planner (similar to a query planner) that chooses the correct data structure to use based on the combinations of operations

  - e.g. for empty point queries: deletes ? hash_set : bloom_filter. To check inclusion

- [ ] Merge operation

### Extra Data structures

At a minimum, we need a `Vec<Option<Box[u8]>>` holding valid keys.

| Range Queries       | Either store keys in a BTreeSet or sort valid keys before each range query. Pick an index between 0 and the max beginning of the valid range.                                                                                                                                                                                       |         | When sorting the valid keys, also filter out `None` |               |               |                     |
| Empty Point Queries | Generate the inserts, and then generate n empty queries. Find out how many invalid empty point queries, generate that many. Loop until all valid empty queries, shuffle the operations. Alternatively, instead of keeping all the operations in memory, keep offsets in the file of where you need to write and fill them in later. |         |                                                     |               |               |                     |
